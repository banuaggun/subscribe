# Subscribe Newsletter

Mobile compatible Subscribe Newsletter consists of Home Page, Form Page and Confirmation Page. In addition, there is a tooltip that I support with javascript and designed with css for email typing errors that may occur while filling the form.
I wrote the codes with Visual Studio Code, transferred it to the CodeSandbox coding environment and shared it on Github. In addition, I compiled it with Netlify over CodeSandBox and published it on a virtual Web API. You can see the example of my project on the web from the [Subscribe Newsletter]() link. (You can also see the responsive version in the Chrome Developer Tools section). And finally, you can see the visual designs of my project on [Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/118447587/Subscribe-Newsletter).
